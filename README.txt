Animation summary: 3-D, first person plane shooter. Navigate a boat trying to prevent enemy planes from reaching your fleet. WS controls thrust of the ship, AD controls yaw, f to switch between tracking camera(which implements LookAt) and first-person mode, mouse to maneuver camera and click to fire. Alt-a freezes the world, but you can still rotate the FP camera with the mouse.

Hierarchical objects: The flagpole (with flag) is a hierarchical object to the player's boat.

Polygonal objects: Two different types of planes were modeled, each with flat shaded faces. Additionally, a single boat type was modeled with flat shaded faces. 

Textured objects: The boat was modeled with texture coordinates that corresponded to proportional coordinates on the unit square. The player boat and all target boats(ie, boats that the planes aim to hit) are textured with paper textures.
